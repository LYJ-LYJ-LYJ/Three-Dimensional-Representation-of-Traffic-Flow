**Description:** 

This script could help teachers(students) from traffic/transportation engineering to teach(understand) the three-dimensional representation of traffic flow in an intuitive way, where X-axis is for time, Y-axis is for space, and Z-axis is for traffic count N(x,t). It allows users  to customize the vehicle trajectories and the temporal and spatial  domain where the observer is standing.
